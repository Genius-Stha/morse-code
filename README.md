# Morse-code

Morse code is a telecommunications method which encodes text characters as standardized sequences of two different signal durations, called dots and dashes or dits and dahs.
Morse code is named after Samuel Morse, one of the early developers of the system adopted for electrical telegraphy. 
There is no distinction between upper and lower case letters.
The duration of a dah is three times the duration of a dit (although some telegraphers deliberately exaggerate the length of a dah for clearer signalling). Each dit or dah within an encoded character is followed by a period of signal absence, called a space, equal to the dit duration. The letters of a word are separated by a space of duration equal to three dits, and words are separated by a space equal to seven dits.

# Implementation
Since all the characters are identified by the dots and dashes , I used dictionary for the morse code and also added audio file to read the audio and preprocess it to from dots and dashes to decode it into original text.
